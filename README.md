# CMD executable PATH for ProDOS's BASIC.SYSTEM

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/a2stuff/prodos-path.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/a2stuff/prodos-path)

ðŸ’¾ Disk images can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/a2stuff/prodos-path/releases) page ðŸ’¾

Build with [ca65](https://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html)

Installation:
* Copy target to ProDOS disk
* From BASIC.SYSTEM prompt, run: `-PATH` from STARTUP (or by hand)

Usage:
```
PATH prefix     - set search path(s) - colon delimited
PATH            - view current search path(s)
cmdname         - load and execute named CMD, if in PATH
```

Once set, binary files of type `CMD` in the specified directories can be invoked by name.
* CMD file is loaded at $4000 and invoked; should return (`rts`) on completion.
* The command line will be present at $200 (`GETLN` input buffer).
* Supports multi-segment, colon-separated paths, e.g. `/hd/cmds:/hd2/more.cmds`
* Commands can use the BI parser for arguments. See `chtype.cmd.s` for an example.

Example:
```
] -/hd/path              - install it
] PATH /hd/cmds:/h2/bin  - set PATH
] PATH                   - verify path
/hd/cmds
] BELL                   - will invoke /hd/cmds/BELL if present
] HELLO                  - will invoke /hd/cmds/HELLO if present
] ONLINE                 - will invoke /hd/cmds/ONLINE if present
```

Notes:
* Search order when a command is typed:
   * ProDOS BASIC.SYSTEM intrinsics (`CAT`, `PREFIX`, etc)
   * BASIC keywords (`LIST`, `PRINT`, etc)
   * CMD files in paths, in listed order
* Allocates a permanent buffer to store the code and path (2 pages)
* `PATH` can be invoked as lower case (e.g. `path /DISK/CMDS`)
* Commands can be invoked as lower case (e.g. `hello`)
* Applesoft BASIC commands are unaffected (but can't be CMD names)
   * Commands with BASIC keywords as _prefixes_ are allowed as long as the command continues with an alphabetic character. For example, `ONLINE` is allowed despite conflicting with the valid BASIC statement `ONLINE GOTO10` which is short for `ON LINE GOTO 10`.

Sample commands included:
* `BELL` - beeps the speaker
* `HELLO` - shows a short message
* `ONLINE` - lists online volumes (volume name, slot and drive)
* `ECHO` - echoes back anything following the command
* `CHTYPE` - change the type/auxtype of a file. e.g. `chtype file,T$F1,A$1234`
  * `T` (type) and `A` (auxtype) are optional. If neither is specified, current types are shown.
  * `S` and `D` arguments can be used to specify slot and drive.
* `CHTIME` - change the modification date/time of a file. e.g. `chtime file,A$1234,B$5678`
  * `A` (date) and `B` (time) are optional. If neither is specified, current values are shown.
  * `S` and `D` arguments can be used to specify slot and drive.
